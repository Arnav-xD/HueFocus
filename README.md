# HueFocus
My project presents a real-time color detection system designed to assist color-blind individuals in identifying colors. System uses a webcam to capture live video and each frame using the OpenCV and NumPy libraries. The captured image is converted from the BGR to the HSV color model,. HSV color ranges act as a simple detection model for colors.
